The GO enrichment figures are generated using ShinyGO server with following steps:
Total immune genes as background and immune genes with repeats as foreground. Both lists are mentioned in Table_1.xlsx
Plots are generated for biological processes, cellular component, and molecular function by keeping Human as species in ShinyGO.
